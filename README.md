# US Homelessness Modeling
## Overview
This repository holds a DATA 3320 project exploring how to model the relationship between market factors and homelessness. Using Housing & Urban Development data, we aim to explore the relation between market factors & homelessness, as well as models of community-level homelessness & see if we can outperform HUD models on the topic.

## Data
The raw data for the file is taken from the 2019 Market Predictors of Homelessness HUD report and is in this repository as `05b_analysis_file_update.csv`. A dictionary explaining the column is stored here as `HUD TO3 - 05b Analysis File - Dictionary.csv`. The HUD report explaining the data can be found [here](https://twitter.com/badend_doll/status/1648447015720988680?t=XLpmct5bTnNtbiHrtucCMQ&s=19).
